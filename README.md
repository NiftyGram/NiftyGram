NIFTYGRAM offers a revolutionary story-sharing and creator-collector experience by leveraging advances in blockchain and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) technology. We believe that creators are at the heart of all content and deserve to be rewarded accordingly. NiftyGram offers the framework for creators to become wildly successful. Our secret sauce comes from the way that we encourage and incentivize users to discover new content.

NIFTYGRAM helps users to earn $DAI for the content they create, including Royalties on future transactions that involve their content. Our platform allows you to create unique, non fungible content pieces. Whether you are a musician, podcaster, visual artist, Vlogger, or anything else involving digital content, you'll be able to immortalize your work onChain. 

Users simply connect a supported wallet to the NIFTYGRAM dapp and start viewing Stories, which are videos, photos, and audio from people with similar interests. Stories created by users are featured in a large card format that viewers can interact with, one Story at a time. During the Story upload process, user media is minted as NFT collectibles which are owned by users and stored in their wallets.
